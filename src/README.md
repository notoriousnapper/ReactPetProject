# BIGGEST ISSUE:
https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/issues/1342
RESOLUTION: 2 THINGS
1. https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount (put function call AFTER mounted,
  meaning the tree is now inserted into actual dom, so you can refer to Dom elements now)
2. add both the JSON and the IMAGE folder to SRC. (I missed the image folder,
  IT WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN DOCUMENTATION OR CODE PEN)
IT WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN THE README WTF AIRBNB.


TODO:
1. NEXT TIME: For WEBSITE ====> CLEAN UP On SKETCH |
 - + MAKE A VIDEO ---> so you can come back to this.  
 - Really ain't got that much time huh (back to debugging/ back-end)

2. Animations to Make
 - Coming in from Right to Left Slide
 - Runs away from developer // personification of code
 - Do that one app animation, but for side stuff
 - TERMINAL idea? or search bar + Chat bar ==> Opens text dialog
 - Maybe have it have a fast - expression ====> Slow it down too much?
 - ====> Have a short like "oh, are you looking for Jesse? He's doing that human thing called napping.  Typical"
 - ====>  GOAL Board ----> Next few months / etc. ====> GUITAR DAMNIT JESSE
 - Goes to bedroom - & I jump out and its like oh --> I got these and that and these .../ point is ...


 - Easter Eggs:
 - ----> Its a declaration ---> // Tell a story through your website.  Not just "here's my stats"
 - ----> (Srsly though ) ----> Easter Eggs & Idk
 - ----> // Can I collect data through my site?
 - ----> // Incorporate AfterEffects w/ button clicks or nah? // Loading animation for sure
